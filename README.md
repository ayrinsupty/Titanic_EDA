# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Analysis Project

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover key insights about passenger survival. Following the EDA, feature engineering and data cleaning techniques are applied to prepare the data for predictive modeling. Finally, a logistic regression model is built to predict survival outcomes based on passenger characteristics.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **📊 Dataset:** Titanic passenger data including demographics, ticket class, fare, and survival status.
- **🎯 Objectives:**
  - Explore and visualize data distributions and relationships.
  - Handle missing values and outliers effectively.
  - Engineer meaningful features such as titles and family size.
  - Build a logistic regression model to predict survival.
  - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- 🥇 Passengers in higher classes had higher survival rates.
- 👩‍✈️ Females survived at a significantly higher rate than males.
- 👶 Children and passengers paying higher fares had better chances of survival.
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Family size and social titles were important predictors in survival likelihood.

## 📚 Usage

The processed dataset and analysis steps can be used as a foundation for building more advanced machine learning models or conducting further data exploration.
